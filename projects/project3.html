                <p><b>The Queen In Me Project</b> is a 12-month program that prepares girls ages 8-21 to meet the challenges of adolescence and young adulthood through a coordinated, progressive series of high-quality activities and learning experiences that help them to achieve social, emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being. Girls participate in 1:1 mentoring, community service, and enrichment activities as they gain the ability to lead themselves and others on a course of action. They also gain the ability to analyze their own strengths and weaknesses, set personal and vocational goals, 
                    and have the self-confidence and self-esteem to pursue and achieve their goals.
                </p>
